## OneSignal Fix

Hello everyone, as we know since kodular last update push notification component stopped working after target SDK to 30. So from many days I am trying to solve this issue and today finally I solved it and all works fine now I think. This extension fix the one-signal subscription issue by some SDK updates. This is an empty extension mean it has no blocks. It just do the SDK thing in our apps and help onesignal to use the FCM library. This extension is currently in BETA phase as I have not tested it in well way. It may have some issue with other components or extensions. I am releasing this extension so users can test it and can report the bugs here and I will try to fix them. User subscription and notification are working very well. I only tested this thing due to lack of time and resources.
